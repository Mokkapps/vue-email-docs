Email clients have this concept of “preview text” which gives insight into what’s inside the email before you open. A good practice is to keep that text under 90 characters.
::

## Usage
Add the component to your email template. Include styles where needed.

```vue
<script setup>
import { EPreview } from 'vue-email'
</script>

<template>
  <EPreview>Email preview text</EPreview>
</template>
```
