## Introduction

`Vue Email` can now be used to render and send emails from the server side, and now with support for [bun](https://bun.sh). This is useful for sending transactional emails, such as welcome emails, password resets, and more.

## Installation

We already have the `compiler` features from the `vue-email` package, but you even can install it without needs to install the `vue-email` package, and you can do it as such install the `@vue-email/compiler` package.

### Config

The `config` method takes two arguments, the first is the path to the directory containing the template files, and the second is an optional config object.


| Key       | Default | Description                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verbose` | `false` | Whether to log the compilation process to the console.                                          |
| `options` | `{}`    | The options to pass to the compiler. [Supported Options](/getting-started/installation#options) |


```ts
import { config } from "@vue-email/compiler";

const vueEmail = config("./templates", {
  verbose: false,
  options: {
    baseUrl: "https://vue-email-demo.vercel.app/",
  },
});
```

### Render

The `render` method takes two arguments, the first is the name of the template file, and the second is an optional props object.

```ts
const template = await vueEmail.render("DefineComponent.vue", {
  props: {
    name: "John Doe",
  },
});
```

### Example

in this example we will use `Express.js` to render and view an email.

::code-group

```ts [Express.js]
import express from "express";
import { config } from "@vue-email/compiler";

const app = express();

const vueEmail = config("./templates", {
  verbose: false,
  options: {
    baseUrl: "https://vue-email-demo.vercel.app/",
  },
});

app.get("/", async function (req, res) {
  const template = await vueEmail.render("WelcomeEmail.vue", {
    props: {
      name: "John Doe",
    },
  });
  res.send(template);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Sending Emails

Once you have rendered your email template, you can send it using any email provider you like.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
`Vue Email` does not provide any email sending functionality, you will need to use a third party email provider to send your emails, check the integration section for more information. [Integrations](/integrations/mailersend)
