Tho this feature is experimental, it is still very powerful, if you are souly using vue and vue-components imports, auto importing is not supported yet, and it will be a while till its supported.


- [x] Render Single File Components from the server side.
- [x] Auto import Components in your `emails` folder. 
> NOTE: For `Nuxt` it will always be the `emails` folder for now, and for node, since you have the option to pick wich folder you wanna use, that will be your default folder to load components from.
- [ ] Auto import vue imports (computed,ref....)

::code-group

```vue [✅ Correct Format]
<script setup>
// Import what you need from vue.
import { defineProps, computed } from 'vue'

const props = defineProps({
  name: String
})

const username = computed(() => props.name.toUpperCase())
</script>

<template>
  <section>
    <Layout>
      <!-- Importing Components that lives inside the emails folder is supported -->
      <h1>Welcome {{ username }}</h1>
    </Layout>
  </section>
</template>

```

```vue [❌ Incorrect Format]
<script setup>
// Auto imports are not supported yet.
const props = defineProps({
  name: String
})

const username = computed(() => props.name.toUpperCase())
</script>

<template>
  <section>
    <Layout>
      <!-- Importing Components that lives inside the emails folder is supported -->
      <h1>Welcome {{ username }}</h1>
    </Layout>
  </section>
</template>
```
